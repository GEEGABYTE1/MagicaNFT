# MagicaNFT 

An automated process to create a number of NFTs

At the moment, the program only makes pixelated NFTs, with only a certain number of character traits.

However, there a `n!` of possibilities, where `n` is the number of physical traits ranging from skin tone to ears to hairstyles.

Users can play around with it and create their own combinations. They can even add different traits themselves if they can find `.png` files of such traits.

Users must run the `script.py` file to interact with the program.

# Things to be Noted 

An `/images` directory will be created to accompany the number of NFTs you create. A <em>/images</em> file will be need to be created for everytime the program runs. This is due to the program not being able to handle file overiding. 

It is strongly recommended that these NFTs should not be sold on the market. This program is for educational purposes only, and is a small project to play around with.
